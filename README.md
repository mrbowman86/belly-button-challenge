## Project Overview

In this project, you'll find a dashboard that allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbial species (Operational Taxonomic Units or OTUs) found in human navels. The dataset demonstrates that while a few bacterial types are highly common, the majority are rare.
